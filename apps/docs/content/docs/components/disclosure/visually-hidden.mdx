# Visually Hidden

VisuallyHidden is a common technique used in web accessibility to hide content
from the visual client, but keep it readable for screen readers.

## Import

```js
import { VisuallyHidden } from '@aphrodite-ui/react';
```

## Usage

It is used to visually hide an element but to make it accessible for
screen-readers. It renders html `<span>` as a proxy.

```jsx
<div>
  <Heading>Title and description</Heading>
  <VisuallyHidden>This will be hidden</VisuallyHidden>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

`VisuallyHidden` has all the styles necessary to hide it from visual clients,
but keep it for screen readers.
